 ('Cachalot', 'The sperm whale or cachalot (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. It is the only living member of the genus Physeter and one of three extant species in the sperm whale family, along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of the genus Kogia.', 'static/images/upload/cachalot.jpg', 900),
 ('Squid', 'Squid are cephalopods in the superorder Decapodiformes with elongated bodies, large eyes, eight arms and two tentacles. Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, bilateral symmetry, and a mantle. They are mainly soft-bodied, like octopuses, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like gladius or pen, made of chitin.', 'static/images/upload/squid.jpg', 800),
 ('Angler Fish', 'The anglerfish are fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes. They are bony fish named for their characteristic mode of predation, in which a modified luminescent fin ray (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure for other fish. The luminescence comes from symbiotic bacteria, which are thought to be acquired from seawater, that dwell in and around the esca. ', 'static/images/upload/angler_fish.jpg', 1100),
('Frilled shark', 'The frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus) and the southern African frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus africana) are the two extant species of shark in the family Chlamydoselachidae. The frilled shark is considered a living fossil, because of its primitive, anguilliform (eel-like) physical traits, such as a dark-brown color, amphistyly (the articulation of the jaws to the cranium), and a 2.0 m (6.6 ft)-long body, which has dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins located towards the tail. The common name, frilled shark, derives from the fringed appearance of the six pairs of gill slits at the shark\'s throat.', 'static/images/upload/Chlamydoselachus_anguineus.jpg', 1200), 
('Squid worm','Teuthidodrilus samae, dubbed as the squidworm, is a species of acrocirrid marine annelid worms. It is free-swimming and can be found in the deep sea water column at depths of 2,039 to 2,912 m (6,690 to 9,554 ft). It feeds on marine snow and can grow to about 9 cm (3.5 in) in length and 1 cm (0.39 in) in width. It is named for the ten squid-like appendages emerging from its head. It was discovered in 2007 in the benthopelagic zone of the Celebes Sea, near the Tawi-Tawi islands of the Philippines. It is the only species in the genus Teuthidodrilus.', 'static/images/upload/squid_worm.jpg', 2500), 
('SnailFish', 'The Liparidae, commonly known as snailfish or sea snails, are a family of marine scorpaeniform fishes. Widely distributed from the Arctic to Antarctic Oceans, including the oceans in between, the snailfish family contains more than 30 genera and about 410 described species, but there are also many undescribed species. Snailfish species can be found in depths ranging from shallow surface waters to greater than 8,000 meters, and species of the Liparid family have been found in seven ocean trenches. They are closely related to the sculpins (family Cottidae) and lumpfish (family Cyclopteridae). In the past, snailfish were sometimes included within the latter family.', 'static/images/upload/snail_fish.jpeg', 7900),
('Amphipoda', 'Amphipoda is an order of malacostracan crustaceans with no carapace and generally with laterally compressed bodies. Amphipods range in size from 1 to 340 millimetres (0.039 to 13 in) and are mostly detritivores or scavengers. There are more than 9,900 amphipod species so far described. They are mostly marine animals, but are found in almost all aquatic environments. Some 1,900 species live in fresh water, and the order also includes terrestrial animals and sandhoppers such as Talitrus saltator.', 'static/images/upload/Hirondellea_gigas.jpg', 10300);
